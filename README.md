# Lab 8: Airbnb Price Prediction

## Overview
This lab focuses on predicting Airbnb listing prices using historical data. The goal is to explore different machine learning models and evaluate their performance in a real-world regression problem.

## Objective
To build predictive models that estimate Airbnb listing prices based on features such as location, number of bedrooms, reviews, and other listing characteristics.

## Methodology
The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed, and three machine learning models—**Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor**—were trained to predict Airbnb listing prices, with their performance compared using standard evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this lab is too large to host on GitHub. Download it HERE : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K4qOfPSHDC-PMMBcRsJ7GWnYtMYPms2V/view?usp=sharing and place it in a folder named `data/` in the repository before running the notebook.

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset and place it in `data/`.  
2. Open `Lab8_Airbnb.ipynb`.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and predictions.

## Expected Results
- Predicted prices for Airbnb listings.  
- Performance comparison of the three models.  
- Insights into which features most strongly influence price.

## Contributions
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- Built and evaluated three machine learning models for price prediction.  
- Visualized and interpreted model results.
